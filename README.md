# CSE2102-LabReact

The quiz system implemented via React is a simple system that has a hard-coded collection of twenty questions, and a randomized order of ten questions to be collated for the purpose of a quiz.

Aside for the 'first principles' libraries, templates, and patterns provided for this lab, the additional use of the 'useState' module from the 'React' library is utilized for the purpose of alternating between simple state changes. Comparatively, the 'useReducer' module facilitates more complex state changes.

Instructions:

1) Install node.js.
2) Use the install npm and install 'react-router-dom'.

       npm install
       npm install reacter-router-dom

4) Download the repository's contents.
5) Place the contents into a desired folder/destination.
6) Navigate to the aforesaid folder/destination via command prompt/terminal.
7) Run the React application on an open port via the command on a development server:

       npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
